                The future belongs to those who know how to imagine it and how to build it. At the heart of our ability
                to innovate lies a vision and ideas but also a fierce determination to anticipate change. <br> <br>

                Research and innovation are the cornerstones of our strategy on technology. This is why every year we
                invest up to 10% of our turnover to create a working environment with the highest possible standards for
                employees, for business and for the community at large. <br> <br>

                Experience, emerging technology and user-centred design are what drive our R&D operations. We never
                cease in our quest to develop new technology and new products and improve the performance of our
                existing ones. <br> <br>

                We constantly strive to study and propose more advanced solutions in terms of:

                    <b>Our research knows no boundaries.</b> <br>

                    Our approach to innovation is based on the sharing of ideas and projects: to create innovation we
                    try to follow many different paths to give everyone the chance to express their full potential. <br>

                    We lean towards collaborative innovation because we are convinced that in order to keep pace with
                    the challenges of the global market open innovation and crowd sourcing offer the chance to identify
                    highly technological, creative solutions. <br>

                    We work with leading universities, research institutes and industrial partners to tackle the
                    technological challenges and emerging requirements in the world of automated logistics. <br>

                    At ICAM we have participated in numerous research projects with some of the greatest Italian
                    companies.

                    <b>We protect the value of our ideas.</b><br>
                    There are many ways for a good idea to lose its value if itâ€™s not protected. At ICAM we believe in
                    the power of innovative ideas and for this reason we systematically protect our intellectual
                    property. <br>

                    A portion of our profit is invested in the filing of patents and trademarks; we make our products
                    competitive by protecting both the technological know-how and the distinctive nature of our brands.
